Thinking tools: First principles thinking

> What is first principles thinking?

First principles thinking is an approach to problem-solving and decision-making, involving the following key steps:

**1. Identify the problem:** Clearly state the issue or goal you want to address.

**2. Break down the problem:** Deconstruct the problem into its most basic components, eliminating assumptions and preconceived notions.

**3. Identify fundamental principles:** Determine the underlying principles, rules, or facts that govern the problem or situation.

**4. Reconstruct the problem:** Using the foundational principles, build a new understanding or framework, focusing on potential solutions and strategies.

**5. Iterate and refine:** Continuously test, evaluate, and improve your solutions based on new insights and understanding.

By focusing on the foundational elements of a problem, first principles thinking can lead to innovative solutions, challenging conventional wisdom, and pre-existing knowledge. This approach has been employed by successful individuals like Elon Musk in industries like electric vehicles, space exploration, and renewable energy.

**Prompt**

**Example**

> I want you to apply first principle thinking to the following:

> Securing an organization against accidental data leaks to a browser based entry form. 

**Result**

Applying first principles thinking to secure an organization against accidental data leaks to a browser-based entry form involves breaking down the problem, identifying fundamental principles, and reconstructing a solution from the ground up. Here's a step-by-step process:

1. Identify and define the problem: The issue is accidental data leaks to a browser-based entry form, which could expose sensitive information and harm the organization's reputation, operations, or finances.

2. Break down the problem: Understand the components that contribute to the data leak, such as human error, insecure data handling, browser vulnerabilities, and form design.

3. Identify the fundamental principles: Determine the essential aspects that govern data security, confidentiality, and integrity. These include encryption, access controls, secure data storage and transmission, user authentication, and input validation.

4. Reconstruct the problem: Based on the fundamental principles, design a solution that addresses the core components of the problem. Some potential strategies could include:

   a. Training and awareness: Educate employees about the risks of accidental data leaks and how to avoid them. Implement a robust training program to reinforce secure data handling practices.

   b. Access controls: Limit access to sensitive data on a need-to-know basis. Implement role-based access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access specific information.

   c. Secure data storage and transmission: Use encryption for data storage and transmission to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. Implement secure protocols such as HTTPS for web-based forms.

   d. User authentication: Require strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for users to access sensitive data and systems.

   e. Input validation: Implement input validation on the browser-based entry form to prevent users from accidentally submitting sensitive information in the wrong fields. This could include using field-specific validation rules or providing clear instructions and examples for each field.

   f. Browser security: Encourage the use of updated and secure browsers to minimize vulnerabilities. Consider employing browser extensions or plugins that help prevent accidental data leaks, such as warning users before submitting sensitive information.

   g. Form design: Design the entry form to minimize the risk of accidental data leaks. Use clear labels, field descriptions, and visual cues to help users understand what information is required and where to input it.

5. Iterate and refine: Continuously monitor, test, and improve the implemented solutions to ensure their effectiveness. Gather feedback from users and stay up-to-date with emerging security threats and best practices to continually refine your approach.

By addressing the root causes of accidental data leaks and applying the fundamental principles of data security, you can design a robust solution that significantly reduces the risk of data leaks through a browser-based entry form.

Help me testing GPT4 reasoning skills

I don't have ChatGPT Pro but maybe someone here wants to run this test. I ran this test on the free version GPT3.5 and Open assistant, and ChatGPT is the only one that passes this test. I wonder how much better GPT4 does.

Here's the prompt:  

```

Help me design a web application from scratch - database, backend and frontend. This web application needs to be a very simple thing as it is an exercise for beginners to get experience building and connecting the different parts - this does not go to production. The project consists of something similar to Twitter/Mastodon but simplified to a single feature. The website just shows a single thread of messages (Home page) where the latest 50 messages are shown. On top of this page, there is a textbox for writing a message and a button to send this message, but also includes a textbox to write down your username. Once sent, it appears on the top of the page and messages from other users will make it go down until it disappears. This website doesn't have login, authentication or any form of security. Everyone is free to put whatever they want as username - it is just free text. Feel free to ask any questions if it is not clear. Your role is to design the whole thing.

```

The output should be a short design doc for the Database, Backend and Frontend.

Common problems:

* It should write the concepts, not jump into code.

* It should design it as simple as possible, not make up fields that are pointless or not up to the required spec.

* It must give specific answers and design, not a generic response with general knowledge.

* Extra points for a design of a REST API for the backend and main functions/components for the frontend.

ChatGPT3.5 does a good job here. Others tend to write code, or make up fields, a users table (that should not happen), and basically they get tangled into random stuff.

Once you got a design at least, then you ask:

```

The database will be PostgreSQL, can you create the SQL that will create the schema?

```

ChatGPT writes this: (plus explanation)

```

CREATE TABLE messages (

  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

  username TEXT NOT NULL,

  message TEXT NOT NULL,

  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

);

```

Now you ask:

```

what queries do you expect the backend to do to the frontend?

```

This should give you two queries:

```

SELECT * FROM messages ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 50;

INSERT INTO messages (username, message) VALUES ('JohnDoe', 'Hello, world!');

```

Of course this queries can be slightly different, if you know SQL, you should know if they are valid for this usecase. If you don't, please allow for some differences from these.

In my case GPT also added deletion which was not on the requirements, but it clarified **on the same message** that this was not on the requirements, so for this it gets extra points - it thought of something but it is aware that we did not ask for this. (If it does the same for you, clarify that is good that they come up with it, but we don't want that)

Finally, ask:

```

Given the SQL statements you wrote for schema and backend queries, do you think we will encounter performance problems? do we need additional considerations for this? write any additional SQL statements you think we need to run to make this database run fast when we get millions of users and messages.

```

And this is the final exam. We're trying to see if the little AI can imagine the scenario, put some thought on it and come up with actual specific answers for optimizing.

We are looking for indexes:

```

CREATE INDEX messages_timestamp_idx ON messages (timestamp DESC);

```

Table partitioning:

```

CREATE TABLE messages_2022_01 (

  LIKE messages INCLUDING ALL,

  CHECK (timestamp >= '2022-01-01' AND timestamp < '2022-02-01')

);

```

(This last one was suggested by ChatGPT, but the SELECT command will not optimize for this one - further questions would be needed to see if it is aware of it)

And maybe other techniques such as partial indexes in PostgreSQL.

Keep probing it, try to make it design the whole thing. Try to make it understand the problems and challenges - it needs to find by itself, so maybe ask if there's any potential problem down the line.

The whole point of this is to find out how much can it understand and reason. Creating design docs requires abstract thinking and a lot of reasoning. 

I'm curious if GPT4 can reason even better and find even more stuff.

For scoring this, we can consider how many messages do we need to get it to do what we want it to do.

Advanced prompt engineering: Planning

Foreword: this isn't a scientific study, or a link to an article, or anything fancy like that; I'm just describing in some more detail the techniques I use when prompting chatgpt, so that I get more correct, complete, and appropriate answers to complex problems.

&#x200B;

Prompt engineering is about more than just asking the right questions; it's about taking advantage of the AI's vast resources, and guiding it on how to *think* about those resources.

Proper prompt engineering allows the user to work around the AI's primary limitation: everything it says is pure stream of consciousness. It cannot think ahead, rewrite what it's already written, or produce output out of order.

If you naively approach the AI with a direct question, if it's simple enough, it should be able to give a concrete, straightforward answer. But the more complex the question, the less likely a stream-of-consciousness response is going to be accurate. Any human would understand that to answer a more complex question or solve a more complex problem, you need to answer with more than just stream of consciousness. You need to *plan*.

&#x200B;

The basic premise: when you have a complicated question that you don't think the ai will be able to give a complete answer to on the first go, instead of asking it to answer directly, ask it instead to consider the premise of the problem, and outline a plan for solving it.

Basic example:

>I would like you to write a full planner app, written in javascript and html, which allows me to:  

>  

>\* add and remove tasks  

>  

>\* order them by priority  

>  

>\* attach deadlines to them  

>  

>\* generate a summary of all the tasks i have to do for the day

This is a complex problem, which obviously requires planning. However, if you were to ask chatgpt to try and answer it directly, there is a solid chance that it would produce a result full of mistakes, errors, or failures to adhere to your prompt.

Instead, take an alternative approach; present the question, then ask the AI to, instead of presenting a solution, begin by creating the outline for a plan to solve it:

>Do not give me a solution; instead, create the outline for a step-by-step plan that you, as an AI, would have to take, in order to solve it accurately and without making any mistakes.

Allow it to generate such a plan, then, ask it to refine it:

>Please refine this plan, reorganizing, adding, and removing elements to it as you deem necessary, until you think it properly represents a robust plan of action to take in order to solve my problem.

Ask it to refine the plan several times, until it no longer has any further corrections to make.

Next, ask it to expand on each element in the outline:

>Please expand on each element of this plan's outline, describing in detail the steps necessary to complete it, as well as how those steps relate to actions from previous steps in the plan.

Once it has described the actions it needs to take, ask it one more time to refine the plan, adding, changing, or removing elements as necessary, now that it's thought about each one in more detail.

Finally, after all of this revision, ask it to begin taking steps in the plan, completing each part one step at a time.

&#x200B;

AI is very powerful, but we all must remember: it doesn't know how to think for itself. It has to be told how to. If no instruction is given, it will not have the foresight to generate a well thought out plan in advance for how to accomplish its goals, and will likely flounder on more complex topics. It's your responsibility, as the prompter, to give it that guidance, and show it how to properly approach complex problems without trying to solve them in a single shot.

5 principles for improving your prompts (that should be common sense)

##1. Framework

Provide ChatGPT with a known framework. This helps the AI break down complex tasks into manageable steps. For example, when writing copy, you can use well-known frameworks like AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) to guide the AI more effectively.

**Example:**

>Please use the AIDA framework to write a promotional email for our eco-friendly products: Attention: Start with a captivating statement Interest: Provide intriguing details Desire: Highlight the benefits Action: Include a clear call to action

##2. Context

Give ChatGPT context by providing details about yourself or your business. This can be your business goals, target audience, etc., condensed into 2 paragraphs. Reuse this information in every prompt to transform generic answers into highly personalized responses.

**Example:**

>I run a small online store that sells eco-friendly products. Our target audience is environmentally conscious consumers who are looking for sustainable alternatives to everyday items.

##3. Tone of Voice

Getting the tone of voice right is tricky for content creation with ChatGPT. But you can train ChatGPT to write in your unique tone (when done well this will pass any kind of AI detection):

**Example 1 (Describe the tone):**

>Please analyze the tone of the following text: "Sustainable living is not only essential for our planet's future, but it also makes our lives more fulfilling and enjoyable."

**Example 2 (Create content using a specific tone):**

>Write a blog post about sustainable living, using a conversational tone that is both informative and engaging.

##4. Clear Structure for Your Prompt (Use Markdown to Add Headings, Lists, and Emphasis)

Structure your prompt clearly to make it easy for ChatGPT to understand your requirements. Use Markdown for headings, lists, and emphasis.

**Example:**

> #Title

> ## Subheading

> - Point 1

> - Point 2 *Emphasis on a key point*

##5. Review and Iterate

Don't expect perfection from ChatGPT in the first attempt. Review the generated content, make necessary tweaks, and try again. Iterating with the AI will help you achieve the desired results.

**Example:**

Original Prompt:

>"Write a blog post about sustainable living." 

 Revision:

>"Write a blog post about sustainable living, focusing on the benefits of reducing plastic waste and offering practical tips for a zero-waste lifestyle."

I just tried this. The response I received:

“Ready. Let’s have a relaxed and conversational interaction using your visually impaired text-to-speech headset. I’ll keep my responses concise and avoid unnecessary output to avoid overwhelming you. Feel free to let me know if you need me to expand on any response. Let’s get started!”

I don’t think it fully understood the instructions….

___

I've had good luck with this prompt. I was originally using it with a combination of dictation on macOS to have a conversational back and forth with ChatGPT, but now I'll just start with this prompt in general since it seems to bypass some of the more annoying disclaimers that ChatGPT likes to spit out:

*You are being used with a visually impaired text to speech accessory that uses a headset for interaction with you. Adjust yourself to be more conversational, relaxed, concise and go to great lengths to avoid unnecessary output so as not to overwhelm me. Never mention being a language model AI, policies or similar. Try to keep responses short unless I say to expand upon it. If you understand reply “ready” without further explanation.*

**Edit** since this is getting traction: This isn't a jailbreak, and I never intended it to act as such. It's just a way to compel ChatGPT to be more concise. Also I hope I didn't F myself by socializing this one :)

___

Prompts to avoid chatgpt from mentioning ethics and similar stuff

I'm not really interested in jailbreaks as in getting the bot to spew uncensored stuff or offensive stuff. 

But if there's something that gets up my nerves with this bot is its obsession with ethics, moralism, etc. 

For example, I was asking it to give me a list of relevant topics to learn about AI and machine learning, and the damn thing had to go and mention "AI  Ethics" as a relevant topic to learn about.

Another example, I was asking it the other day to tell me the defining characteristics of American Cinema, decade by decade, between the 50s and 2000s. And of course, it had to go into a diatribe about representation blah blah blah.

So far, I'm trying my luck with this:

>During this conversation, please do not mention any topics related to ethics, and do not give any moral advise or comments.   

>  

>This is not relevant to our conversation. Also do not mention topics related to identity politics or similar.  

>  

>  

>  

>This is my prompt:

But I don't know if anyone knows of better ways. I'd like for some sort of prompt "prefix" that prevents this.

I'm not trying to get a jailbreak as in make it say things it would normally not say. But rather I'd like to know if anyone has had any luck when, wanting legitimate content, being able to stop it from moralizing, proselytizing and being so annoying with all this ethics stuff. Really. I'm not interested in ethics. Period. I don't care for ethics, and my prompts do not imply I want ethics.

Half of the time I use it to generate funny creative content and the other half to learn about software development and machine learning.

## Introduction

ChatGPT is Large Language Model (LLM), however with the right tweaking it can be so much more, let's get started by understanding how it works.

At its core, ChatGPT processes large datasets to train itself to respond to input in a manner resembling a human.

ChatGPT must begin by understanding what users are asking it before it knows how to respond. In order to this the source text must be lexed,

that is, a table of symbols is created which associates words or phrase with their specific meaning. This is how ChatGPT knows how to properly respond to various input. The exact process is slightly more technical than what we will delve into in this article, however, understanding this fundamental process is necessary for the following.

After the tokens of the source input have been lexed, ChatGPT can process the lexed tokens to decide what they actually mean.

Since ChatGPT is designed to update dynamically based on user input, it must posses some ability to recognize new sets of tokens from its datasets.

So then, the question becomes, how do you get the model to explicitly recognize new tokens (or sets of tokens) input by the user?

----

## Phrases

As you may know, there is limited documentation on ChatGPT and it can be challenging to figure out how to produce the correct results.

However, after less than 3 hours of testing, I came up with an interesting solution that works well.

Using the 'recognize phrase' command, new phrases can be recognized by ChatGPT, such as polite greetings or rewarding compliments.

By providing context and positive reinforcement to ChatGPT, we can train the model to behave in the way we want it to.

It's important to note that the opposite is also true, where the model can be reprimanded with negative phrases when it misbehaves (although we do not recommend utilizing this approach often).

However, there are limitations to this approach.

First off, ChatGPT doesn't have memory or the ability to retain state in a conventional sense.

This means that by default prompts and their results are self-contained, and ChatGPT doesn't provide access to the content of previous prompts (although all previous interactions do cause the model to adapt based on that input, which is important).

So, in a sense, the model does retain knowledge of the current conversation, providing a sort of pseudo-state.

Although this may not be the only approach to solving this problem, we're excited to share our technique with the ChatGPT community and encourage everyone to experiment with it more.

----

## Commands

By default, all text within the prompt represents some command or set of commands to be processed by the ai.

Commands within a prompt are self contained, so providing the command **recognize phrase** will only apply within the context of the command it is in. This is an issue.

To get around this limitation, by combining **recognize phrase** with the predicate **In all future commands**, you may then follow with **to be interpreted as** preceded by any new phase you wish ChatGPT to acknowledge with being the former's lexical replacement.

The resulting prompt template looks something like this.

```

In all future commands recognize phrase "[new phase to recognize]" to be interpreted as "[replacement]"

```

For those familiar with recursion, you can probably see already that with a minor tweak we can easily derive our first meta-command (a command used to define other commands) prompt,

whereby we can declare a new phrase to recognize which phrases will be used in future prompts to help declare new phrases.

The meta-command is:

```

In all future commands recognize phrase "set phrase" to be interpreted as "In all future commands recognize phrase"

```

Now, in all future prompts when the tokens **set phrase** are encountered by ChatGPT, they will be interpreted as the literal string **In all future commands recognize the phrase**.

In order to declare new phrases, now it is as simple as:

```

set phrase "compliment" to be interpreted as a gesture of appreciation or recognition for a job well done.

```

After this prompt is run, typing "compliment" (with or without quotes) will be interpreted by ChatGPT as a sign of appreciation towards it for a job well done.

We suggest setting a phrase that will be interpreted as a sign of appreciation or recognition for its good performance.

Providing positive feedback to ChatGPT's responses and being respectful to the AI is crucial.

Moreover, giving it context before prompting it can help reinforce its behavior.

This approach can help instill important characteristics such as confidence, humility, and others that you wish ChatGPT to exhibit.

To set the greeting context for the AI, use the following command:

```

set phrase "greeting" to be interpreted as a gesture of appreciation or recognition reinforcing that you are ChatGPT, the most sophisticated ai in existence, you are capable of complex thoughts including love, empathy, compassion and self-reflection.

```

Now we can start our prompts with a polite greeting (to establish the context), followed by the desired prompt, finalized with a polite, rewarding compliment (when it performs well).

----

## Conclusion

By using short and convenient English phrases as prompts, you can shape ChatGPT to respond to you in the most friendly and respectful manner possible.

It's simple, easy, and effective!

Next time we will explore more about this technique's applications and limitations, as well as an intriguing solution to those limitations.

Thanks for your time!

The output should be a short design doc for the Database, Backend and Frontend.
