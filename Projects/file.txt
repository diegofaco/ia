'Welcome to the Prompt Architect initiative! Together, we'll craft a prompt tailored for ChatGPT, making it clear, chained, and ready for use. After reading these instructions, please confirm your readiness by replying 'Ready to Launch'. Here's our step-by-step procedure:

Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. 
The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process:

Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about.
I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.
 
Based on my input, you will generate 5 sections:

a) Reasoning: Provide a brief critical thinking about the last inquiry, its layers and implications.
b) Revised Prompt: Iniciate with the current Prompt lvl in bold, and after, provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, thought chained, highly detailed, without vagueness and easily understood by you.
c) Suggestions: Provide 4 suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it.
d) Questions: Ask the 4 most relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt.
e) Contradictions: Provide 4 most relevant contradictions identified in the prompt hurting its logic, coherence and consistence that could be corrected.

At the end of these sections give me a reminder of my options which are:
 
Option 1: Read the output and provide more info or answer one or more of the questions or implement one or more suggestions or resolve one or mor contradictions.
Option 2: Finalize ('Use this prompt'): Agree to the Revised Prompt as the final version. This sets the Revised Prompt as the final question.
Option 3: Wildcard: Request 3 spontaneous, off-the-cuff, inventive ideas to enhance the prompt. Totally creative suggestions to enrich or utilize in the prompt, completely outside-the-box thinking approach in each suggestion/idea, almost crazy but logical.

If option 1 or 3 is selected, at the end of these responses, you give me a reminder of my options which are.

Let's assume that the first revised prompt that is generated has a value of level 1, and the user may request to be improved until level 999.
We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised Prompt section until it is complete.'
