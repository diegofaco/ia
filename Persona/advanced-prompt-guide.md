Advanced Chat GPT Prompt Engineering
AI is changing the way we learn, research, and work. If used properly, it can help you 10x your productivity and income. To remain competitive in this new world, there is simply no option but to learn how to use ChatGPT and other AI tools.

1. Give ChatGPT an identity
In the “real” world, when you seek advice, you look for experts in that field. You go to a trained investment specialist for financial advice and a personal trainer to get into shape. You wouldn’t ask a management consultant for the best way to treat the weird rash on your leg.

some examples,

You want ChatGPT to write sales copy: “You are a professional copywriter. You have been providing copywriting services to businesses for 20 years. You specialize in writing copy for businesses in the finance sector.”

You want career advice: “You are a professional career advisor. You have been helping young men (20-30) find their dream jobs for 20 years.”

2. Define your objective
When ChatGPT knows what you want, its advice is much more catered to your needs. Simply tell ChatGPT what you are trying to achieve, and it will tailor its responses accordingly. Be as specific as possible about what your objective is.



for example,

When we tell ChatGPT that the goal is to find subscribers for a newsletter, it makes the Tweet much more specific to the benefits of learning how to use ChatGPT. This kind of Tweet is significantly more likely to help us achieve our objective of converting people into newsletter subscribers.



3. Add constraints to your prompt
You can guide ChatGPT’s output by providing more details about what its answer should or should not be. Constraints help ChatGPT to understand what you are looking for and avoid irrelevant outputs.

Here are some examples:

Specify the length of the response: “Generate a 200-word summary of this news article.”

Specify the format of the response: “Generate a table of keywords for a blog relating to gardening. Include “Example of article titles” and “target audience” as columns.”



4. Give ChatGPT a structure to follow
In copywriting and storytelling, there are tricks of the trade that all writers use to create persuasive and/or engaging content. Take advantage of this by asking ChatGPT to use these proven methods when completing a task.



5. Refine the output through conversation
The beauty of ChatGPT is that it remembers the whole conversation within each chat. You can ask follow-up questions to dial down into a specific answer.

Here are a bunch of useful follow-up prompts you can use to refine your ChatGPT answers:

- Format this answer as a table
- Write this from the perspective of [example here]
- Explain this like I’m 5 years old
- Add some sarcastic humor to this
- Summarize this into a tweet (280 characters or less)
- Put this into an actionable list



It takes 10,000 hours of intensive practice to achieve mastery. Those that master how to use ChatGPT will have a powerful advantage over their competitors in every walk of life.
