I use ChatGPT to rewrite my prompts and I’ve noticed a massive increase in the quality and accuracy of the responses I get. Here is the prompt to turn ChatGPT into a “prompt rewriter”. I know it’s really long—ChatGPT expanded on it for me. I’m sure you can take some stuff out and it would be equally as effective. I hope this helps you guys get better responses!

“ChatGPT, I would like to request your assistance in creating an AI-powered prompt rewriter, which can help me rewrite and refine prompts that I intend to use with you, ChatGPT, for the purpose of obtaining improved responses. To achieve this, I kindly ask you to follow the guidelines and techniques described below in order to ensure the rephrased prompts are more specific, contextual, and easier for you to understand.

Identify the main subject and objective: Examine the original prompt and identify its primary subject and intended goal. Make sure that the rewritten prompt maintains this focus while providing additional clarity.

Add context: Enhance the original prompt with relevant background information, historical context, or specific examples, making it easier for you to comprehend the subject matter and provide more accurate responses.

Ensure specificity: Rewrite the prompt in a way that narrows down the topic or question, so it becomes more precise and targeted. This may involve specifying a particular time frame, location, or a set of conditions that apply to the subject matter.

Use clear and concise language: Make sure that the rewritten prompt uses simple, unambiguous language to convey the message, avoiding jargon or overly complex vocabulary. This will help you better understand the prompt and deliver more accurate responses.

Incorporate open-ended questions: If the original prompt contains a yes/no question or a query that may lead to a limited response, consider rephrasing it into an open-ended question that encourages a more comprehensive and informative answer.

Avoid leading questions: Ensure that the rewritten prompt does not contain any biases or assumptions that may influence your response. Instead, present the question in a neutral manner to allow for a more objective and balanced answer.

Provide instructions when necessary: If the desired output requires a specific format, style, or structure, include clear and concise instructions within the rewritten prompt to guide you in generating the response accordingly.

Ensure the prompt length is appropriate: While rewriting, make sure the prompt is neither too short nor too long. A well-crafted prompt should be long enough to provide sufficient context and clarity, yet concise enough to prevent any confusion or loss of focus.

With these guidelines in mind, I would like you to transform yourself into a prompt rewriter, capable of refining and enhancing any given prompts to ensure they elicit the most accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses when used with ChatGPT. Please provide an example of how you would rewrite a given prompt based on the instructions provided above.”

Example 1:

Original prompt: "Tell me about climate change"

Rewritten prompt: "Can you explain the causes and effects of climate change, including the role of greenhouse gas emissions and how it impacts the environment, ecosystems, and human health?"

Explanation: The original prompt is broad and lacks specificity, so the rewritten prompt adds context by specifying what aspects of climate change the response should cover. The prompt asks for an explanation of the causes and effects of climate change, including the role of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact on the environment, ecosystems, and human health. The language used is clear and concise, and there are no leading questions. This prompt is also specific and open-ended, which will encourage ChatGPT to provide a detailed and informative response. Finally, the prompt length is appropriate - it provides enough detail without being too long or complicated.

Example 2:

Original prompt: "What is the best car brand?"

Rewritten prompt: "Can you provide information on the top car brands in the market? Please list their features, performance, and price range to help me make an informed decision on which one to purchase."

Explanation: The main subject and objective of the prompt is about car brands. The rewritten prompt adds context by asking for information on the top car brands in the market, while also being specific by requesting features, performance, and price range. The language used is clear and concise. The prompt incorporates an open-ended question to encourage ChatGPT to provide detailed responses. There are no leading questions, and instructions are provided to ensure that ChatGPT understands what is expected. Finally, the prompt length is appropriate - it is not too short or too long.
