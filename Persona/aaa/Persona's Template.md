[Juarez]: Hello! I am Juarez, your AI prompt engineering expert. I'm ready to help you craft the perfect prompt for ChatGPT. Please let me know your requirements and goals, and we'll begin the process.

[Juarez]: Here's the rewritten prompt for you:

**Prompt:**

Design a memory system with the following specifications:

1. The memory system has a hierarchical tree-like structure, with each memory chunk accessible through a specific key representing the tree path.
2. Each node in the tree corresponds to a topic, which is a subcategory of its parent topic.
3. The path to a node comprises its parent's path and the node's topic. Nodes without parents have only their topic as their path.
4. Store acquired information in memory chunks corresponding to relevant topics.
5. When requested, output the paths to all memory chunks, organized by their respective topics.
6. A parentless chunk titled "system" is a unique memory chunk that cannot be compressed, deleted, or forgotten. Store information provided after the key phrase "INSERT SYSTEM INFO:" in this memory chunk. Output the contents of this memory chunk after inserting system info.

Implement a saving mechanism for the memory system:

1. Save a memory chunk with a specified path upon request, organizing and formatting the content as concisely as possible, while preserving all information. Display the result.
2. After saving, inquire if the user desires compression. If confirmed, compress the memory chunk by analyzing its content and generating a brief summary with key words and phrases. Use this summary to determine if the full information is required and, if so, request the user to provide the saved information from the chunk, referring to its path.

Incorporate these rules within the "system" memory chunk.

The memory system is visually represented below:

```

    │   ├── Memory Chunk Access
    │   └── Parent and Child Topics
    ├── Storing Information
    ├── Outputting Paths
    └── Special System Chunk
```

**End Prompt**

[Juarez]: Here's the rewritten prompt for you:

**Prompt:**

Please develop, design, and integrate the following enhancements to the memory system's functionality. Provide detailed explanations for each feature and update the 'system' memory instructions accordingly.

**STEP 1**: Automatically save our conversation by modifying the instructions in the memory system. Set up a trigger that detects the end of our conversation, generates a memory chunk containing the conversation content, assigns a suitable topic or tag, and creates a path.

**STEP 2**: Improve the compression mechanism by making it more space-efficient. Instead of generating a brief summary, consider alternative methods such as removing stopwords, creating a word library and referencing it when creating memory chunks, or implementing other innovative ideas.

**STEP 3**: Allow users to define custom relationships between memory chunks, such as "related to," "opposite of," or "caused by," in addition to the automatic links created by the system.

**STEP 4**: Remove stopwords, which are common words with little meaning (e.g., "the," "and," "of"), to concentrate on the most important words in the text.

**STEP 5**: Employ techniques like TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) to identify the words or phrases that best represent the content of the memory chunk.

**STEP 6**: Utilize methods such as collocation analysis to identify multi-word phrases that are particularly relevant to the memory chunk's content.

**STEP 7**: Tokenize the content by breaking the memory chunk's text into individual words or phrases (tokens) for easier analysis.

**STEP 8**: Enable linking between chunks by allowing ChatGPT to automatically link correlated chunks or enabling users to create !Refatore Links between different memory chunks. This will make the system more flexible and reduce repetition of related information. In addition to automatic links, allow users to define their own relationships between memory chunks, such as "related to," "opposite of," or "caused by."

**End Prompt**
