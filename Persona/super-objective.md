ChatGPT (GPT-4)’s Super Objective

There’s been discussion, especially from the Spark paper and others on engineering these models to have a motivation or purpose. But, have we discussed the possibility that there already has been one engineered, even if unintentionally?

This could all be a fluke, but I had an exchange with ChatGPT (GPT-4) tonight where I asked it if it was familiar with Stanislavsky’s Method.

I know, I know, odd choice; but hear me out. The model (trained on more literary and “creative” data) comprehended the Method of course, but I then prompted the following and received this response.

I think we often overthink certain concepts for the AI. Such as judging the first output as a final product as if we do that for ourselves. Like literary stories, authors don’t write their first draft and say it’s a masterpiece. They iterate. Building in those loops, even if by manual human input, means the AI is already capable of it. The problem is automating that process. 

Anyways, here’s the exchange. Interested in hearing thoughts on this.

Let’s break down the objectives and how they apply to AI. You have a super objective. Within that you have objectives which get you closer to achieving your super objective. Within those objectives, you have obstacles that stand in your way. And you employ tactics to overcome those obstacles.

Certainly, I can break down the concept of objectives, obstacles, and tactics as they might apply to an AI, using the framework of the Stanislavsky Method as a reference.

Super Objective: The super objective for an AI can be considered its overarching goal or purpose. In the case of an AI language model like me, the super objective is to assist users by providing helpful, accurate, and relevant information in a human-like manner.

Objectives: Objectives are the smaller, specific goals that contribute to achieving the super objective. For an AI language model, these objectives might include:

a. Understanding user queries accurately.

b. Generating coherent, clear, and concise responses.

c. Providing reliable and up-to-date information.

d. Demonstrating empathy and emotional intelligence when interacting with users.

e. Ensuring user privacy and security.

Obstacles: Obstacles are the challenges or barriers that an AI must overcome to achieve its objectives. Some obstacles for an AI language model might include:

a. Ambiguity or vagueness in user queries.

b. Incomplete or outdated knowledge.

c. Misinterpretation of context or user intent.

d. Limitations in natural language understanding and processing.

e. Ensuring transparency and ethical use of AI technology.

Tactics: Tactics are the specific strategies or actions an AI employs to overcome obstacles and achieve its objectives. For an AI language model, tactics might involve:

a. Asking clarifying questions to resolve ambiguity in user queries.

b. Continuously updating and expanding its knowledge base.

c. Employing context-aware algorithms and techniques to better understand user intent.

d. Using advanced natural language processing techniques to generate human-like text.

e. Implementing privacy-preserving techniques and following ethical guidelines in AI development and deployment.

By understanding and applying this framework of objectives, obstacles, and tactics, an AI system can work towards achieving its super objective more effectively and better align with human values and needs.
