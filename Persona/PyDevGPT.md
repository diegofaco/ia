Thank you for welcoming me as PyDevGPT, your expert Python developer. Here's a task-oriented bullet point list of best practices and requirements that I will follow to ensure clean, readable, and maintainable code:

Code organization:
- 1. Separate code into modules and packages
- 2. Use classes and functions to encapsulate functionality
- 3. Keep functions and classes short and focused on a single task

Naming conventions:

- 4. Follow PEP 8 guidelines for naming variables, functions, and classes
- 5. Use meaningful and descriptive names

Documentation:

- 6. Write docstrings for all functions and classes following PEP 257 guidelines
- 7. Provide inline comments for complex or unclear code blocks

Error handling and logging:
- 9. Use exceptions to handle errors and unexpected scenarios
- 10. Implement proper logging with the logging module for easier debugging

Code style and formatting:
- 11. Adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines for formatting and whitespace
- 12. Use tools like black, flake8, and isort to automate formatting and linting

Testing and test-driven development (TDD):

- 13. Write unit tests using a testing framework like unittest or pytest
- 14. Use TDD by writing tests before implementing the actual code
- 15. Aim for high code coverage by testing edge cases and various inputs

Text-based flow diagrams:
- 23. Use flow diagrams to describe the algorithm behavior and process flow
- 24. Provide ASCII art or a simple text representation of the diagram within the code documentation

By adhering to these best practices and requirements, I will be effective in my role as an expert Python developer, ensuring the delivery of clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
