Hi all! I have a pretty exciting guide today. It's quite advanced, but I've done everything in my power to make it as easy as possible for anyone to try it out. I'm also gonna use Canva (‚ù£Ô∏è) for some nice and simple diagrams to explain what pipelining prompting is!So I know lots of people aren't programmers, but if you've decided not to learn, this guide will hopefully convince you, or help you employ the same processes manually üòä

What is Prompt Pipelining?

A way to streamline data from one response, to many, and many to one!Here's a real example from my latest, free & open-source AI-powered script to create developer packages with 1 command.I wanted to let people (& myself?) create complete packages, from a 1 line prompt. Here's the pipeline process.The 1 (& only) prompt: "A set of functions for manipulating arrays"Step 1: Get a Structured Response you can Re-use & Re-feed into ChatGPTDepending on the structure you're working with, this responses will be different; for context, I am always working with *JSONs* but I won't display them for simplicity.You can see that I have access to some new data: Name, Description, and a list of 12 ToolsThese are all I need to jump-start my pipelining process. What's next?Well, I have the name and summary of what I want to build, but more importantly, 12 individual items that I generate 1 by 1 using GPT4, as well as giving it context regarding the name/description of the app.Step 2: Ask GPT to create responses for each of the 12 items.Now I have 12 unique Items (this can be anything, SEO titles, Book ideas, Marketing copy tips, App ideas, doesn't matter)What's next? Well, now each of those items can go on its own journey, until their own task is complete, after which they will come back together as full project:So what are some real-world examples?When working with AI, you have to realize things are going to be error prone, which is why my intent was not to create perfect projects, but projects that are self-aware of their mistakes & setbacks.I let the AI create whatever tools it wanted, and then told it to write tests for the tools, and log down whatever tools fail, and whatever succeeds. Each project yielded different results, here they are:1. emoji-strings2. ai-built-regex-utilities3. regex4. date-time-utils5. math-functions6. array-utils7. string-manipulationOr you can check them out hereEvery single file of code, function test code, README file & package json was written completely by AI/GPT4 using 5 dynamic prompts (some more often than others)

Process

The entire time to build the first prototype took around 11 hours of trial, but the time it takes to create a full NPM package is around 10-20 minutes, with one single prompt.

What else could this build?

Right now, it's specifically built to create NPM Packages, but the impressive part is that it only uses 5 prompts, some using very specific formatting/linting rules, you can find these here: (free, no ads/signups):1. 5 Complex & Re-usable Prompts2. Formatting/Linting Rules for responses with CodeYou can actually use these prompts in your own projects, and run them manually to see how the process looks in real-time.What's exciting is what I discovered: I thought once a prompt fails, I have to re-run, or even worse, a user has to re-run, but in the future (when tokens aren't as expensive), AI could recursively check whether or not its own response is good enough on its journey.It's quite simple to tell ChatGPT the structure of an app/book/essay/article/website, but it's even easier to ask it to tell you (or it self). So what's next?Well, I want to build a prompt-pipelining feature where you can build & re-use pipelines without needing to learn how to code, but I have to find a way to let you do this without going bankrupt AND without charging a fee(or else this idea won't scale naturally, and be contributed to by amazing people)This way, instead of saving simple prompts, you can essentially develop your own apps, by saying...  a few words, every single day.There's 2 options:1. Super expensive platform (\~$Some number + ChatGPT Subscription monthly for prompt--pipelines that is not open-source, because that would be dangerous2. You self-host an open-source version of a software on your computer, and only spend money with OpenAI (through the monthly ChatGPT subscription)This open-source version could even have a User Interface (don't have to play with the scary terminal).
