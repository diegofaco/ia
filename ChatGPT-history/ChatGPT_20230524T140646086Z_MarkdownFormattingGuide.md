Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text for easy readability. Here are some commonly used formatting options in Markdown:

1. Headings: Use the hash symbol (#) followed by a space to create headings. The number of hash symbols indicates the heading level, with one hash symbol for the main heading, two for subheadings, and so on. For example:

```shell
# Main Heading
## Subheading 1
### Subheading 2

```

1. Bullet Points: Use an asterisk (*), a hyphen (-), or a plus sign (+) followed by a space to create a bulleted list. For example:

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

```

1. Numbered Lists: Use numbers followed by a period and a space to create a numbered list. Markdown will automatically increment the numbers for you. For example:

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

```

1. Bold Text: Surround the desired text with double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__). For example:

```markdown
**bold text**
__bold text__

```

1. Italic Text: Surround the desired text with single asterisks (*) or single underscores (_). For example:

```scss
*italic text*
_italic text_

```

1. Code: Use backticks (`) to format inline code. For example:

```scss
Use the `print()` function to display output.

```

1. Code Blocks: Indent a block of code by four spaces or one tab to create a code block. Alternatively, you can use triple backticks (```) before and after the code block for better readability. For example:

```

```

def greet():
print("Hello, world!")

```

```

1. Links: To create a hyperlink, use square brackets ([]) for the link text followed by parentheses (()) containing the URL. For example:

```csharp
[Visit OpenAI's website](https://openai.com)

```

1. Images: To display an image, use an exclamation mark (!), followed by square brackets ([]) for the alt text, and parentheses (()) containing the image URL. For example:

```less
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)

```

These are just some of the formatting options available in Markdown. You can explore more advanced features and extensions based on the specific Markdown implementation or editor you are using.
